                                    <p class="text-grey editable">Aaron recently completed his HBA at Western University in Canada, focusing on international relations &amp; French, with a particular interest in globalization &amp; post-colonial politics. Years of passionate engagement in social issues have taken Aaron from the cr&egrave;ches of post-Apartheid townships in Cape Town to the bustling streets of Mumbai all the way to the hilltop villages of<em> ind&iacute;gena</em> in Eastern Colombia. Aaron&rsquo;s avid interest in global affairs led to his selection as a Junior Team Canada ambassador on a trade and development mission to Central &amp; South America, as well as a domestic mission to the Canadian Arctic. Upon returning from a year&rsquo;s exchange in Europe &amp; a development internship in Central Russia, Aaron co-founded the Canadian Youth Think Tank, an organization which offers opportunities for young Canadians to produce written articles on Canadian and global public policy news, developments &amp; events. Aaron is also a World Vision Canada Youth Ambassador, a member of the Globe and Mail Student Advisory Board &amp; a Junior Research Fellow at the NATO Council of Canada. Most recently, Aaron was elected as a City Youth Councillor in his hometown of Mississauga &amp; he was also selected to be Canada&rsquo;s Youth Ambassador to the Organization of Security and Co-operation in Europe, engaging in negotiations for a Youth &amp; Security Action Plan. In October 2014, Aaron travelled to Ukraine as one of 90 Canadians to be an International Election Observer monitoring the <em>V</em><em>erkhovna Rada</em> parliamentary elections. In the past, he has also met with Prince Charles &amp; Desmond Tutu; climbed South Africa's iconic Lion's Head (by moonlight); &amp; celebrated Christmas mass with the Pope. For his service, Aaron has most recently been recognized with the Queen's Young Leaders Award. For relaxation, Aaron enjoys listening to rock &amp; a good read by the local harbour. In the long term, Aaron intends to pursue a career in international law &amp; justice, &amp; eventually in the Foreign Service.</p>
